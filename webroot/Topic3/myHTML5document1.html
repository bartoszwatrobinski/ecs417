        <em class="cw">I'm living in Warsaw. Warsaw is a beautiful city with many interesting monuments and other places worth visiting.
            <br>Public transport in Warsaw is well organised and it's easy to get to any place in the city despite there are only two underground lines.
            <br>Some of the must-see places in Warsaw are Warsaw Old Town and "Lazienki Krolewskie" Park-Palace Complex.

        <em class="cw2">
            <br>Vistula river flows through Warsaw.
            <br>A little disadvantage of living in Warsaw are traffic jams during rush hours, but they are easy to avoid by using public transport which is cheap.
            <br>If someone wants to find a silent place to learn, there are many libraries.
